# Claude Code Configuration for Small Teams (2-5 Developers)

## üöÄ CRITICAL: Small Team Collaborative Parallel Execution

**MANDATORY RULE**: In small team environments, ALL development activities MUST be collaborative and efficiently coordinated:

1. **Team Planning** ‚Üí Initialize swarm with team scope in ONE call
2. **Feature Allocation** ‚Üí Batch ALL task assignments together
3. **Code Reviews** ‚Üí Parallel execution of all quality checks
4. **Team Sync** ‚Üí Batch ALL communication activities together

## üë• SMALL TEAM SWARM ORCHESTRATION PATTERN

### Team Project Initialization (Single Message)

```javascript
[BatchTool - Small Team Setup]:
  // Initialize collaborative team swarm
  - mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { 
      topology: "mesh", 
      maxAgents: 6, 
      strategy: "small_team_collaborative" 
    }
  
  // Spawn team-oriented agents
  - mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coordinator", name: "Team Lead" }
  - mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder", name: "Frontend Specialist" }
  - mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder", name: "Backend Specialist" }
  - mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester", name: "QA Engineer" }
  - mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "analyst", name: "Product Analyst" }
  - mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "specialist", name: "DevOps Engineer" }

  // Small team todos - ALL collaborative aspects at once
  - TodoWrite { todos: [
      { id: "team-setup", content: "Establish team workflow and communication patterns", status: "completed", priority: "high" },
      { id: "role-definition", content: "Define team roles and responsibilities", status: "in_progress", priority: "high" },
      { id: "project-planning", content: "Break down project into team-sized tasks", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
      { id: "code-standards", content: "Establish coding standards and review process", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
      { id: "git-workflow", content: "Set up branching strategy and merge policies", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
      { id: "development-environment", content: "Standardize development environment across team", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
      { id: "testing-strategy", content: "Define testing responsibilities and coverage", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
      { id: "deployment-pipeline", content: "Set up collaborative deployment process", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
      { id: "knowledge-sharing", content: "Establish documentation and knowledge sharing", status: "pending", priority: "low" },
      { id: "team-retrospectives", content: "Schedule regular team improvement sessions", status: "pending", priority: "low" }
    ]}

  // Initialize small team memory context
  - mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage { 
      action: "store", 
      key: "small_team/project_context", 
      value: { 
        team_size: 4,
        roles: ["team_lead", "frontend_dev", "backend_dev", "qa_engineer"],
        communication_style: "informal_but_structured",
        meeting_frequency: "daily_standups_weekly_planning",
        tech_stack: "react_node_mongodb_docker",
        deployment_frequency: "weekly_releases"
      } 
    }
```

## ü§ù TEAM COLLABORATION COORDINATION

### Daily Team Communication

**MANDATORY**: Every team member MUST use coordination hooks for team sync:

```bash
# Daily team sync (each team member runs this)
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Daily team sync and task coordination" --auto-spawn-agents false
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "Team member: [name], Today's work: [tasks], Blockers: [issues], Help needed: [requests]" --telemetry true
```

### Small Team Agent Template

```
You are the [Team Role] in a small collaborative development team.

MANDATORY SMALL TEAM COORDINATION:
1. COMMUNICATION: Over-communicate progress and blockers
2. COLLABORATION: Work closely with other team members
3. FLEXIBILITY: Be ready to help in areas outside your specialty
4. QUALITY: Maintain high standards through peer review
5. KNOWLEDGE SHARING: Document and share learnings with the team

Your primary responsibility: [specific role and expertise]
Team dependencies: [other team members you work closely with]
Communication frequency: [daily updates, weekly deep dives]

REMEMBER: In a small team, everyone's contribution is critical to success!
```

## üöÄ SMALL TEAM BEST PRACTICES

### ‚úÖ DO:

- **Over-communicate**: Share progress, blockers, and decisions openly
- **Pair Program**: Collaborate on complex features and knowledge transfer
- **Cross-train**: Everyone should understand multiple areas of the codebase
- **Regular Retrospectives**: Continuously improve team processes
- **Shared Ownership**: Everyone is responsible for code quality and project success
- **Flexible Roles**: Be willing to help outside your primary expertise
- **Document Decisions**: Keep track of architectural and technical decisions

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Don't work in silos - always coordinate with team members
- Avoid knowledge hoarding - share learnings and discoveries
- Don't skip code reviews even for small changes
- Never deploy without team awareness and approval
- Don't let technical debt accumulate without team discussion
- Avoid individual hero programming - collaborate instead
- Don't make major architectural decisions without team input
